# **ETH_CTRLCNC**
Ethernet control card for interfacing up to 3 Axis of step&amp;dir step motor or servo motor driver.

# Description
 The **"my_custom_7i96"** is a general purpose, FPGA based programmable I/O card with 100 BaseT Ethernet host connection.The **"my_custom_7i96"** uses standard parallel port pinouts and connectors for compatibility with most parallel port interfaced motion control / CNC breakout cards/ multi axis step motor drives, allowing a motion control performance boost while retaining a reliable real time Ethernet interface.
